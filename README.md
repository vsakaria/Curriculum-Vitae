<h1>Curriculum-Vitae</h1>

<p>My passion is Software Engineering using strong Object Oriented principles and BDD as well 
as great design and user experience. Because I feel well grounded in OO I am happy to dive into any language or code base. I start with use cases, which lead into my tests, and drive my code. The results is a simple & flexible mind and communication that is concise and clear. It is difficult to encapsulate my personality, however people would describe me as fun, creative, altruistic, confident, enthusiastic, and inquisitive. I love to travel and recently have been to the far east and Brazil. I also enjoying dancing and music as well as socialising and talking to new people.<br/></p>

My skills in Rspec's mocking and stubbing code deepened with the use of send, should_receive, stub, with, and_return and mocking objects. Other skills include ActiveRecord dirty, ActionMailer, staging code and shipping, security flaws and designing code that is evolutionary .</td>

    <td class="tg-031e"><b>Javascript/jQuery/Jasmine</b>
Writing solid, reusable OO Javascript libraries using techniques such as prototype
functions, function callbacks, and getting rid of global variables. Dealing with async
Ajax calls using the deferred promises design pattern. In addition to using libraries
such as jQuery, Underscore.js, Leaflet.js and the Rdio Api. I also use Jasmine BDD
and I want to continue learning Backbone.js & Node.js.
<br/><br/>
<b>Ruby on Rails (MVC)</b>
Developing web apps using thorough OO design principles including fat models and
skinny controllers, DRY and single responsibility. Thorough unit and functional
testing. Using gems such as Mocha, OmniAuth and Devise. As well as clean concise
code using encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphic association and single table
inheritance.
<br/><br/>
<b>BDD/TDD</b>
I love testing because I believe in the benefits of it as a source of documentation, as
a method for improving the way I write clean compact code using agile, and (to
quote Uncle Bob) “Because of the tests, software becomes soft again.”.
<br/><br/>
<b>Ruby</b>
Designing code to look beautiful as well as functional. Studying the documentation
and increasing vocabulary.
<br/><br/>
<b>HTML/CSS</b>
Designing front-end with and without Bootstrap/Foundation. Media queries for
responsive design & mobile.
<br/><br/>
<b>Design</b>
I have a good eye for design and consistently seek new design ideas. I can use
Photoshop.
<br/><br/>
Other skills: Git, SQL, Postgres, Heroku, Unix, Photoshop,
Fireworks, UX, Pair Programming.
