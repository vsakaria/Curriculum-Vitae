<p>
My passion is Software Engineering using strong Object Oriented principles and BDD as well as great design and user experience. Because of this I love JS coupled with UX/UI, and want to pursue a career as a client side developer. I get a real buzz out of feeding use cases into tests and then writing code. I strive to communicate concisely & clearly, and love discussing new solutions as a team. It is difficult to encapsulate my personality, however people would describe me as fun, creative, altruistic, confident, enthusiastic, and inquisitive. I love to travel and recently have been to the far east and Brazil. I also enjoying dancing and music as well as socialising and talking to new people.

      I worked on adding features to a code base of 20000+ lines. I produced a fully automated customer referral system using various APIs including the Recurely billing API. All my code was writing using BDD, my skills in Rspec's mocking and stubbing deepened with the use of send, should_receive, stub, with, and_return and mocking objects. Other skills include Delayed Jobs, Cookies, ActiveRecord dirty, ActionMailer, RegEx, Haml, SASS, Coffeescript, staging and shipping code, assessing security flaws and designing code that is evolutionary.<br/>
      I also ran the most successful social media campaign and was consistently praised for my pixel perfect pages.

  <td valign="top"><b>Javascript/jQuery/Jasmine</b>
    Writing solid, reusable OO Javascript libraries using techniques such as prototype
    functions, function callbacks, and getting rid of global variables. Dealing with async
    Ajax calls using the deferred promises design pattern. In addition to using libraries
    such as jQuery, Underscore.js, Leaflet.js and the Rdio Api. I also use Jasmine BDD
    and I want to continue learning Backbone.js & Node.js.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Ruby on Rails (MVC)</b>
    Developing web apps using thorough OO design principles including fat models and
    skinny controllers, DRY and single responsibility. Thorough unit and functional
    testing. Using gems such as Mocha, OmniAuth and Devise. As well as clean concise
    code using encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphic association and single table
    inheritance.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>BDD/TDD</b>
    I love testing because I believe in the benefits of it as a source of documentation, as
    a method for improving the way I write clean compact code using agile, and (to
    quote Uncle Bob) “Because of the tests, software becomes soft again.”.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Ruby</b>
    Designing code to look beautiful as well as functional. Studying the documentation
    and increasing vocabulary.
    <br/><br/>

    Designing front-end with and without Bootstrap/Foundation. Media queries for
    responsive design & mobile.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Design</b>
    I have a good eye for design and consistently seek new design ideas. I can use
    Photoshop.
    <br/><br/>
