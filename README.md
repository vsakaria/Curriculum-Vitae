<p>
My passion is Software Engineering using strong Object Oriented principles and BDD as well as great design and user experience. Because I feel well grounded in OO I am happy to dive into any language or code base. I start with use cases, which lead into my tests, and drive my code. The results is a simple & flexible thinking and communication that is concise and clear. It is difficult to encapsulate my personality, however people would describe me as fun, creative, altruistic, confident, enthusiastic, and inquisitive. I love to travel and recently have been to the far east and Brazil. I also enjoying dancing and music as well as socialising and talking to new people.

      I worked on adding features to a code base of 20000+ lines. I produced a fully automated customer referral system using various APIs including the Recurely billing API. All my code was writing using BDD, my skills in Rspec's mocking and stubbing deepened with the use of send, should_receive, stub, with, and_return and mocking objects. Other skills include Delayed Jobs, Cookies, ActiveRecord dirty, ActionMailer, RegEx, Haml, SASS, Coffeescript, staging and shipping code, assessing security flaws and designing code that is evolutionary.<br/>
      I also ran the most successful social media camping and was consistently praised for my pixel perfect pages.

    Writing solid, reusable OO Javascript libraries using techniques such as prototype
    functions, function callbacks, and getting rid of global variables. Dealing with async
    Ajax calls using the deferred promises design pattern. In addition to using libraries
    such as jQuery, Underscore.js, Leaflet.js and the Rdio Api. I also use Jasmine BDD
    and I want to continue learning Backbone.js & Node.js.

    code using encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphic association and single table
    inheritance.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>BDD/TDD</b>
    I love testing because I believe in the benefits of it as a source of documentation, as
    a method for improving the way I write clean compact code using agile, and (to
    quote Uncle Bob) “Because of the tests, software becomes soft again.”.
