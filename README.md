<h1>Curriculum-Vitae</h1>

<p>My passion is Software Engineering using strong Object Oriented principles and BDD as well 
as great design and user experience. Because I feel well grounded in OO I am happy to dive into any language or code base. I start with use cases, which lead into my tests, and drive my code. The results is a simple & flexible mind and communication that is concise and clear. It is difficult to encapsulate my personality, however people would describe me as fun, creative, altruistic, confident, enthusiastic, and inquisitive. I love to travel and recently have been to the far east and Brazil. I also enjoying dancing and music as well as socialising and talking to new people.<br/></p>
